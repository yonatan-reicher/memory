## Things I Want to Get Her

- A Record Player.
  I want to buy Shanina a record player. I should really get her one after how
  much the one I bought her actually caused her, and after she gave her's to Dan.
- A folding electric bike.
  She's been wanting a folding bike for so long!

- A Neatly Organised Cats clone with our characters
- An Alias web version

## Medical

Currently, 2025-10-29, she uses a pill for her Epilepsy, and a pill for anxiety.
The anxiety pill is called Assival, and it is based on Diazepam.

Being recognized is partialtially abled:
Shanina got recognized for a temporary 20% disability not for PTSD, but for
"work adaptivity" or something similiar. She should totally be recognied for
PTSD! 
We are currently waiting to see how many disability percentage she is going to
get for her epilepsy. Probably not a lot - because she does not have records
of her strokes, and she has not had strong symptoms for a while. And because
her epilepsy is "מדומה".
