# The Research Catechism

The research catechism is a question-framework to help you structure and focus
on good research. The idea is to talk about these questions every day with your
collaborators, and make sure you agree on them at the end of every meeting.

## 1. Problem
What is the problem? What opportunities does addressing it create?

## 2. Insight
What is the key insight? What conceptual contributions does our solution
provide?

## 3. Claims
How do we know the key insight is good? What measurable claims can we make about
the solution?

## 4. Evidence
What evidence do we have to back up the claims?
