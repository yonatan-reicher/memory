It is 2025-12-15, 09:13, Monday. I have a couple of lectures and tutorials that
I missed, that I should probably get back to. But I really don't feel like that
\- I have much more important things on my mind! What should I do?

## Things that I need to watch:
- Storage systems lecture & tutorial
- Computer architecture tutorial
all considered, this will probably take about 4 hours to watch, all together. I
don't think I can really allocate this much time.

## Things I am currently working on:
- Latex to Lean
- Lens + SL
- Clipping
- Computer architecture HW 2

About clipping - I could probably just cap $w$ to be some non-zero epsilon
value, or just multiplying by a very large number instead for dividing by zero.
But, maybe, I should just turn around and do the clipping properly - in clip
space. Yeah. I probably should.
