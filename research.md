Hopefully, this will be the last file I open for remembering what Shachar and I
discussed.

2025-11-11
Meeting with Shachar. Discussion about Katamino, shachar wrote a Katamino
program in Z3 and got up to 7 shapes. Discussion about MathComp.
Shachar recommended I always have a project to work on, and have something I am
reading or learning.

## Working on
* lean-boards
* parser-monad
* parser-combinator
* latex-2-lean
* Reading MathComp
* Project with Hila

# parser-monad
The parser monad is pretty much just what it sounds like, it's building up
parsers as functions from input that modify an input and return a value, and
treating them as a monad let's you construct them very easily.
