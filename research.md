Hopefully, this will be the last file I open for remembering what Shachar and I
discussed.

Meeting with Shachar. Discussion about Katamino, shachar wrote a Katamino
program in Z3 and got up to 7 shapes. Discussion about MathComp.
Shachar recommended I always have a project to work on, and have something I am
reading or learning.
