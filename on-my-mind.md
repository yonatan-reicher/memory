# On My Mind

It is 2025-12-25, 09:38, Thursday. The technion feels very quiet, and it makes
me calm. I went to the supermarket to get some groceries. I need to call my mom
and tell her that I plan to stay over the weekend over here.

I also need to give some strong work on computer graphics! I think that's the
thing that feels most urgent to me.

Something that I shouldn't forget about is *the seminar report*. I have to do it
either today or tomorrow, and I know that I'll probably forget. But I really
don't feel like doing it right now.

One more thing is, I should make sure I collect all my things from the faculty,
because I thing it might be closed on Saturday.
Things to collect:
1. Floor 4 fridge
2. Floor 4 freezer (egg rolls!)
3. Floor 2 fridge
4. Floor 2 sink dishes
