A campaign setting inspired by the world of "Pyre".

The exile plains are a place where nations of the world send their most
treacherous, rebellious criminals as banishment from society. The secret reason
for doing (instead of e.g. killing them,) is that there is a way to escape from
the exile realms. Creatures cannot naturally escape on their own, they must
partake in a scared ritual governed by the sun and the moon, ran by a shadowy
elite of some kind.

The idea in the framing of the campaign is to follow the stars and secret
instructions and to discover the equivalent of the night-wings, the lone
minstrel, and some sneaky escape plan to reshape society.

The moon, only referring to himself as the accompanying party, appears in a
wagon along with some of the PCs as they hall a new member into the wagon, and
set of on their way to meet the planer. The campaign should play out as in each
ritual, the party meets an opponent at the peak of some celestial landmark and
they fight their opponent, after conversing, crafting, talking, and exploring
the strange terrain.

The interpretation of ritual is that the sun and the moon are the dual forces of
rebirth, and that ascending from the exile plains is a process of rebirth of the
soul. The reason creatures cannot ascend on their own is because a soul binds
you to a plain of existence, and that is an ancient magic created by Existence
and governed by the sun.

Sleep and wake are a process of tuning with the realm of existence, and are a
form of death and rebirth in the same plain of existence, and that is governed
too by the sun and moon, in some way.
