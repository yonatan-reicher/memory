Youtube channels I care about:

* Tsoding
* Gabriel Torch
* Greg Guevara (mentoring and artistic life tings)
* Sylvan Franklin?
* SpoonFedStudy (Cringe asian guru)


Maybe:
* Bread on Penguins?
* No Boilerplate
* Joshua Blais (Emacs and other things? I don't know much about him, but I want
  to watch more)


I just saw one video by and I was interested:
* Magsupyourmind (a video about a line a day)
* Roro (a video about Tatami Galaxy and The Night is Short Walk On Girl)

Also: I should watch the videos in [[things-to-check-out]]
